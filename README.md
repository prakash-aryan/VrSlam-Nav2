This project is a virtual reality simulation of SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) and NAV2 (Navigation 2) using the Turtlebot3 robot in a virtual room created with Unity. The simulation runs on the Meta Quest 3 virtual reality headset.

## Overview

The main components of this project are:

- [Turtlebot3](https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3): A simulated version of the Turtlebot3 robot.
- [Unity Assets](https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/1): Used to create a virtual room for the simulation.
- [Unity Robotics Hub](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Unity-Robotics-Hub): Used as a reference for setting up ROS (Robot Operating System) and robotics communication.
- [OpenXR SDK](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenXR-SDK) and [Meta XR All-in-One SDK](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/meta-xr-all-in-one-sdk-269657): Used for building the project for the Meta Quest 3.

## Unity Version

This project was developed using [Unity 2021 LTS](https://blog.unity.com/engine-platform/introducing-unity-2021-lts).
