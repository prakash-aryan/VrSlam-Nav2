This project is a virtual reality simulation of SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) and NAV2 (Navigation 2) using the Turtlebot3 robot in a virtual room created with Unity. The simulation runs on the Meta Quest 3 virtual reality headset, providing an immersive experience for exploring the capabilities of SLAM and NAV2 in a controlled virtual environment.

## Overview

The main components of this project are:

- [Turtlebot3](https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3): A simulated version of the Turtlebot3 robot, a small, affordable, and programmable robot widely used for education and research purposes. The Turtlebot3 is equipped with sensors and actuators that enable it to navigate and interact with its environment.
- [Unity Assets](https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/1): Used to create a realistic and detailed virtual room for the simulation. The assets provide a variety of 3D models, textures, and materials that enhance the visual quality and realism of the virtual environment.
- [Unity Robotics Hub](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Unity-Robotics-Hub): Used as a reference for setting up ROS (Robot Operating System) and robotics communication within the Unity environment. The Unity Robotics Hub provides tools, tutorials, and examples that facilitate the integration of ROS with Unity, enabling seamless communication between the simulated robot and the virtual environment.
- [OpenXR SDK](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenXR-SDK) and [Meta XR All-in-One SDK](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/meta-xr-all-in-one-sdk-269657): Used for building the project for the Meta Quest 3 virtual reality headset. These SDKs provide the necessary tools and libraries for developing VR applications that are compatible with the Meta Quest 3 and other OpenXR-compliant devices.

## Unity Version

This project was developed using [Unity 2021 LTS](https://blog.unity.com/engine-platform/introducing-unity-2021-lts), which offers long-term support and stability for the project. Unity 2021 LTS provides a reliable and performance-optimized platform for developing virtual reality applications, ensuring a smooth and immersive experience for the user.
